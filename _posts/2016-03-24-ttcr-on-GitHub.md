I moved the source codes of ttcr and HGmod on GitHub today.  ttcr contains C++ codes to do raytracing for geophysical applications.  You can get the files [here](https://github.com/bernard-giroux/ttcr.git).

HGmod can be used to generate synthetic models useful for hydrogeophysical modeling. The C++ source code can be found [here](https://github.com/bernard-giroux/HGmod.git).
